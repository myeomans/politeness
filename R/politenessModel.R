#' Pre-Trained Politeness Classifier
#'
#' @description Pre-trained model to detect politeness based on data from Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013)
#' @param texts character A vector of texts, each of which will be given a politeness score.
#' @param num_mc_cores integer Number of cores for parallelization.
#' @details This is a wrapper around a pre-trained model of "politeness" for all the data from the 2013 DNM et al paper.
#' This model requires grammar parsing via SpaCy. Please see \code{\link{spacyr}} for details on installation.
#' @return a vector with receptiveness scores
